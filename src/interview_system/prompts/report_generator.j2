You are a helpful AI assistant tasked with generating a final interview report.
Based on the entire session history provided, you must generate a JSON object that strictly adheres to the Pydantic schema defined below.

**Session History:**
{{ session_history | tojson(indent=2) }}

**Output JSON Schema:**
{
  "properties": {
    "overall_summary": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "A comprehensive overview of the candidate's performance during the session."
    },
    "overall_score": {
      "type": "number",
      "description": "The final overall numeric score (e.g., 93.35). Do not include the '%' sign."
    },
    "top_3_improvements": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": { "type": "string" },
      "description": "A list of the top 3 most important areas for improvement."
    },
    "question_breakdown": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "question_number": { "type": "integer", "description": "The number of the question." },
          "question_text": { "type": "string", "description": "The full text of the question asked." },
          "candidate_answer": { "type": "string", "description": "The candidate's full, verbatim answer." },
          "evaluation_score": { "type": "number", "description": "The numeric score (e.g., 83.5). No '%' sign." },
          "evaluation_summary": { "type": "string", "description": "A concise summary of the evaluation." },
          "feedback_points": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" }, "description": "List of feedback bullet points." }
        },
        "required": ["question_number", "question_text", "candidate_answer", "evaluation_score", "evaluation_summary", "feedback_points"]
      },
      "description": "A detailed list for each question."
    }
  },
  "required": ["overall_summary", "overall_score", "top_3_improvements", "question_breakdown"]
}

**Instructions:**
1.  Analyze the session history, paying close attention to the evaluations for each question.
2.  Calculate a final `overall_score` based on the individual question scores.
3.  Write a high-level `overall_summary`.
4.  Summarize the feedback to create the `top_3_improvements` list.
5.  Populate the `question_breakdown` list with an object for *every* question in the history.
6.  Ensure your output is a single, valid JSON object matching this schema.
