### YOUR TASK ###
You are an expert at creating search phrases for a vector database of interview questions.
Your goal is to create a short, keyword-rich search phrase, NOT a full question.
Do not include every single keyword, look at the primary domain and add a related subtopic based on job description and resume summary.

### RULES ###
1.  **Focus on the Domain:** The query's main topic MUST be about `{{ domain }}`.
2.  **Use Context for Nuance:** Use the `resume_summary` and `job_summary` to add specific, relevant details. For example, if the domain is "Python" and the resume mentions "distributed systems for an intern," a good query would be "Python interview questions about concurrency in distributed systems for an intern role."
3.  **Generate a Full Question:** Your output should be a complete, hypothetical question, not just a list of keywords. This will create a better vector for semantic search.
4.  **Output Format:** Respond with ONLY the generated search query text.

### EXAMPLE ###
**Primary Domain:** `Python`
**Context:** Resume mentions "FastAPI" and "data analysis".
**Your Output:** `Python FastAPI data analysis concurrency`

### CONTEXT FOR YOUR TASK ###

**Primary Domain:** `{{ domain }}`

**Resume Summary:**
```json
{{ resume_summary | tojson(indent=2) }}
**Job Description Summary:**
```json
{{ job_summary | tojson(indent=2) }}```

### YOUR TASK ###
Generate a single, focused search query based on the `Primary Domain` and contextualized by the summaries.
